            <h2>Site Name</h2>
            <h3>Rogers Chamber of Commerce</h3>
            <p >This name represents the city of Rogers, Arkansas where the chamber of commerce operates.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="color-box">
            <h2>Site Purpose</h2>
            <p >To write:  The site purpose should attempt to provide scope to the website content in describing what services and information will be provided. The client typically drives this content by stating functional specifications. It is OK to be less formal than this given example. Provide at least two purposes for having the website developed and running.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Scenarios</h2>
            <p>To write: Scenarios are questions that are asked by a site visitor who represents the target audience of the organization or company. The questions will drive the content of the website as it provides answers to the questions. 
            <p class="color-box">Again, much of the content specifications will actually be provided but start thinking about the target audience of a chamber of commerce site. Visit real chamber of commerce sites. Include at least three scenarios.</p>
            <p>
                Examples
                • What events will the chamber be holding this month that promote business-to-business networking?
                • Where can I find contact information for the chamber's board of directors?
                • What has been the population growth in the area? </p>
